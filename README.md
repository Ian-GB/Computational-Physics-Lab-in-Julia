# Computational-Physics-Lab-in-Julia

This repository contains the exercises from the M.Sc. degree-level course in computational physics _Laboratorio di Fisica Computazionale_ held at the University of Trieste. The language of choice of the lectures is Fortran, but I took this as a chance to study Julia. I am not crediting the professor yet, because they know nothing about this repo as of today.

Most of my code is still Pythonic Julia, for which I apologize, but my hope is to dive deeper into the features of the language and improve the code as I get acquainted with it. Currently, the biggest issue with the repository, though, is that I would like the Pluto notebook (or its HTML version) to be displayed seamlessly by GitHub, but it does not seem to work that way, so the code is still basically unreadable. It is also poorly commented but that may change, too, otherwise the didactic purpose of this repo would be missed. The repo is public, indeed, so anyone may learn something from my failures.

Enjoy!
